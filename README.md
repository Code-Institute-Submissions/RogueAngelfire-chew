# Chew

This is the 3rd Milestone Assignment by Robin Collins

### A website for people to store and share recipies

I like the idea of recipes uploaded based on the ingredients provided to identify if the dish is indulgent or healthy
the selling point for this would be the instant recognition of a graphical Devil/Demon or Angel/Cherub to
see if the food is healthy or not so healthy (all food better than no food).

I'd like to include a macro pie chart identifying the Proteins, Carbohydrates and fats using the information
gathered by the Angel or its evil counterpart. Again this will be a visual representation for even athletes or bodybuilders
and select the best options for their fitness goals.

At this early stage of the project, my concerns are more to the users who supply their recipes and should be in a position
to be the only person to edit/delete their input. However, I feel this could be a stretch goal for this assignment
but will this will protect peoples creative input and further protect them from malicious intervention from a maybe a rival chef or
just a troll in general.

### Wireframes

Here are the initial designs made of this website with the idea of simplicity.

This is a large image which can be scrolled across revealling the page layout with mobile and tablet design including desktop views.

###  UI

For this particular assignment, I thought a lot harder over my visual design as what I like was not received as well as I expected. As I decided I was making a recipe based website I knew that I needed
to reflect a colour associated with food that looks fresh and stands out. Fresh being like fresh produce, therefore, using green as like plants and vegetables.
However, I didn't want to use red of the meat as could be offensive as a colour that can bleed on the screen
and possibly be detrimental to an audience as vegetarian and vegan dishes welcome and becoming more popular
and have come a long way in 20 years and this could give people the curiosity and could opt for a healthy alternative or just try a new alternative.

I did originally have a light green option then I thought a darker green would be better but chose the subtle colour of my first choice then I also went with a lighter grey as the 
alternate footer colour as this added contrast to the green almost in a sense of country and city where
again this could reflect into the website suggesting rural and urban foods, for example, a meal made by foraging
and the another that is a Street Dish.

I like the idea that when on a Desktop view people can get inspired with the tablet and mobile options there is
the look and feel of a menu or a cookbook with simplistic but beautifully presented information. This would tick the boxes of being designed with the approach of mobile-first due to its responsive design.

### UX

I worked briefly as a trainee chef last year when my photography career was struggling. However, my bosses egos became an
obstacle in one of the passions I had for 20 years which was a real shame as I've always seen all careers as an extension
of a family. As there are enough weddings for all photographers to share the wealth and the same applies to all chefs, cooks
and web designers. However, there are small pockets of selfishness all around these days. That's partially where this idea comes from
as I have plenty of friends, family and ex colleges very interested in my idea as a long term project.

I'm hoping to have a login area where people can submit their recipes. There will be options for them to place them into categories for example Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. It workout based on the percentage of Proteins, Carbohydrates, fats and
sugars if the meal is healthy or something for not so healthy but a tasty treat. The information will  be displayed as
I mentioned before in the format of an Angel or Demon. This I feel will be the challenge and possible the stretch goal but some
form macros displayed in a pie chart possible beneficial to athletes as I mentioned earlier. I find this challenge
daunting and extremely exciting at the same time as has now struck a chord with one of my other passions of exercise and fitness
which has become more important with the unfortunate crisis of 2020.

Inputs from users will be protected from malicious possible rivalry as I could potentially lose all menus through general vindictiveness
which sadly is the darker side of the benefits of technology.

The page will feature an "add" menu option which features the following mandatory input required to contribute to the Recipies:

Select Meal - Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner
Menu Name
add image  
submitted by (hopefully I can get this to register with a user who has already logged in)
ingredients
Method
Proteins
Carbohydrates
sugars

I feel more could be added but that might be a stretch goal with so many already.
A further stretch goal could feature comments from other users who tried a menu and has improved it
or turned it into a completely different dish entirely. Cooking is probably the only universal thing everyone has some passion.
My mother says she hates it but is making cakes all the time as cooking has many subsections.
Another stretch goal would be to add to Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner a go further with possibly Starter, Mains and Dessert.
The possibilities could be endless with even a amuse bouche and side-orders a possibility.

For now, though I will focus on security with Submit, Edit and Delete - Hopefully with a confirmation that delete was requested.

### Features

### Design

## Colours

- #8bc24b This Green is used on the Navigation and also with the header settings.
white and black are my alternate colours with greys on the forms.

I also used a grey footer.

## Fonts

I picked Lobster font for the Chew logo it works really well I think, simple and effective.
The other font was Roboto as I wanted to stick with it from previous project for its popularity and my continuity.

#### Exsisting Features


#### Features Left to Implement

### Technologies Used

- Balsamiq for my Wireframes.
- Bootstrap was used for testing mainly.
- Materialize for the majority of my frameworks.
- Font Awesome has been implimented for all my icons.
- Github was used as hosting service.
- GitPod for where I carried out all my coding.
- Heroku is what I used to deploy this app which is a container-based cloud platform service.
- Unsplash is where I obtained my images from when I worked out I couldn't submit mine to MongoDB which brings me to
- MongoDB an amazing database website.
