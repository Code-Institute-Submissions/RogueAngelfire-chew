### A website for people to store and share menus

I like the menus uploaded based on the ingredients provided to identify if the dish is endugent or healthy
the selling point for this would be the instant recognition of a graphical Devil/Demon or Angel/Cherub to
see if the food is healthy or not so healthy (all food better than no food).

I'd like to include a macro pie chart identifying the Proteins, Carbohydrates and fats using the information
gathered by the Angel or it evil counter part. Agian this will be a visual representation for even sport people
and athletes to select the best options for themselves.

At this early stage of the project my concerns are more to the users who supply their recipies should be in a position
to be the only people to edit/delete their input. However, I feel this could be a stretch goal for this assignment
but will protect people creative input and further protect them from malicious intervention from a rival chef or
just a troll in general.
