# Chew

This is the 3rd Milestone Assignment by Robin Collins

### A website for people to store and share menus

I like the menus uploaded based on the ingredients provided to identify if the dish is endugent or healthy
the selling point for this would be the instant recognition of a graphical Devil/Demon or Angel/Cherub to
see if the food is healthy or not so healthy (all food better than no food).

I'd like to include a macro pie chart identifying the Proteins, Carbohydrates and fats using the information
gathered by the Angel or it evil counter part. Agian this will be a visual representation for even sport people
and athletes to select the best options for themselves.

At this early stage of the project my concerns are more to the users who supply their recipies should be in a position
to be the only people to edit/delete their input. However, I feel this could be a stretch goal for this assignment
but will protect people creative input and further protect them from malicious intervention from a rival chef or
just a troll in general.

### Wireframes

Here are the inital designs made of this website with the idea of simplicity

###  UI

For this particular assignment I though a lot harder over my visuals as what I like has generally not
been received as well as expected. As I decided I was making a recipie based website I knew that I needed
to reflect a colour associated with food that looks fresh and stands out. Fresh being like fresh produce
However, I didn't want to use red of the meat as could be offensive as a colour that can bleed on the screen
and possibly be dextrimental to an audience as vegetaian and vegan dishes welcome and becoming more popular
and extremely nice and people not in this category could opt for a healty alternative or just through curiosity.

I did orignally have a light green then a darker green but chose the subtle colour of a lighter grey as the 
alternate footer colour as this added contrast to the green almost in a sense of country and city where
again this could reflect into the site suggesting rural and urban foods for example a meal made by forreging
and another that is a Street Dish.

I like the Idea that when on a Desktop view people can get inspired with the tablet and mobile options there is
the look and feel of a menu or a cookbook with simplistic but beautifully presented information. This would definatley 
tick the boxes of being designed with the approach of mobile first due to its responsive design.

### UX

I worked briefly as a trainee chef recently when my photography career was struggling. However, my bosses egos became an
obstacle in one of my passions I had for 20 years which was a real shame as I've always seen all careers as an extension
of a family. As there are enough weddings for all photographers to share the wealth and the same applies to chefs cooks
and web designers. However, there are small pockets of selfishness all around these days. Thats where this idea comes from
as I have plenty of friends, family and ex colleges very interest in my idea as a long term project.

I hoping to have an login area where people can submit their recipies. There will be options for them to place them 
into categories for example Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. It workout based on percentage of Proteins, Carbohydrates, fats and
sugars if the meal is healthy or something for not so healthy but a tasty treat. The information will the be displayed as
I mention before in the format of a Angel or Demon. This I feel will be the callenge and possible the stretch goal but some
form macros displayed in a pie chart possible benificial to athletes alike. I actually find this challenge
daunting and extremely exciting at the same time as has now struck a cord with one of my other passions of exercise and fitness
which is probaly more important with the unfortunate crisis of 2020.

Inputs from users will be protected from malicious possible rivalry as I could potential lose all menus through general vindictivness
which sadly is the darker side of the benifits of technology.

The page will feature an add menu option which feature the following mandetory input required to contribute to the Recipies:

Select Meal - Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner
Menu Name
add image  
submitted by (hopefully I can get this to register with a user who has already logged in)
ingredients
Method
Proteins
Carbohydrates
sugars

I feel more could be added but that might be a stretch goal with so many already.
A futher stretch goal could feature comments from other users who tried a menu and has improved it
or turned it into a completely diffent dish entirely. Cooking is probably the only universal thing everyone has some passion.
My mother says she hates it but is making cakes all the time as cooking has many sub sections.
Another stretch goal would be to add to Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner a futher Starter, Mains and Dessert.
The possiblities could be endless with even a amuse bouche and side-orders a possiblity.

For now though I will focus on security with Submit, Edit and Delete - Hopefully with a confirmation that delete was requested.
